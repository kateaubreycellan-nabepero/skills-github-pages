# Welcome to my page

A github pages demo using markdown and some markdown code.

Currently doing [tutorials](https://github.com/skills/github-pages) from github pages.

Sample code
```c
int sum(int a, int b)
{
  return a + b;
}

int main(int argv, char **argc)
{
  int a = 5, b = 20;
  int total = sum(a, b);
  printf("Sum of 2 numbers: %d + %d = %d", a, b, total);
  return 0;
}
```
